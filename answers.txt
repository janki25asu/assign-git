2) What does fast-forward in git mean?
If there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch, a fast-forward merge can be performed. Git shifts the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer in fast-forward merge, without creating an extra merge commit.


3) Why should you have different branches?
On a single project, there are lots of developers working at a time. Branching allows every developer to separate their work from each other.
It is also useful for version control.


4) In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
usually there is one repository but if needed more than one remote repositories with different names can be there.
